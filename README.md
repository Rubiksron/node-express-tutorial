# node-express-tutorial
Source code that is part of a 5 hour tutorial covering Node.js and Express.  We walk through how to install the environment, import external functionality, and create a database.  I'm using MongoDB for persistence and Express for routing.  NPM for managing packages and 3rd party libraries and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend.
